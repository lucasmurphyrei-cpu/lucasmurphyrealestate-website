      "lifestyle_summary": "If you want Lake Michigan living at a fraction of what North Shore communities charge -- 132 acres of blufftop parkland, beach access, and the Oak Leaf Trail outside your door -- Cudahy is the best-kept secret on Milwaukee's south side. You will commute to downtown in 15 minutes, grab pizza at a neighborhood institution that has been serving since 1982, and walk your dog along bluffs with panoramic lake views. This is a genuine company town built by meatpackers that still works for a living, where your dollar stretches further and the community pride is real. If you are a first-time buyer, investor, or anyone who values lakefront access without the lakefront price tag, Cudahy delivers.",
